## Installation

To begin with download the [latest version of the Adobe XD file](https://github.com/learncss/xd-tailwindcss/blob/master/Tailwindcss%20XD.xd)

When you installed the file it's time to add it to your Adobe Cloud Documents by doing following.

1. Open the downloaded file.
2. Goto `File > Save As` and select Cloud Documents in the `Save to` field.
3. Rename the file.
4. Hit that Save button and begin using it in your next Adobe XD design. _(You will still need to click `Link Assets` in the new project and select the `Tailwindcss XD` file)_

A special thanks to [Christian W. Hansen](https://github.com/mrcrille) for his TailwindCSS 1.x repo. I found it after building most of this and I liked the style of it, and having the shadows done was a huge time saver.
